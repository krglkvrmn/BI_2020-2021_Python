# Visualization homework

These scripts cover basics of data visualization using *matplotlib.pyplot* and *seaborn* as well as some advanced chart customization.

## Description

#### Simple line plot

Simple plot which is drawn with *matplotlib.pyplot* and shows comparison of different sorting algorithms.

#### Length distribution of fasta file

#### "Bar of pie"

This chart is a way of representing relative size of some groups. Drawing this chart requires relatively

deep immersion into some aspects of *matplotlib*. 

Note that "Pie" and "Bar" are drawn separately and then joined together with external editor. Implementation of such joint within code is possible, but can significantly raise it's complexity and lower reusability.
